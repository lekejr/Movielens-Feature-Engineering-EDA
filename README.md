## 1. Introduction

The **MovieLens dataset** is one of the most widely used benchmark datasets for developing and testing movie recommendation systems.  
Developed by the **GroupLens Research Group** at the University of Minnesota, it includes user ratings, movie details, and user-generated tags reflecting viewing preferences over time.

This project performs **Feature Engineering** and **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the MovieLens dataset to uncover data-driven insights that can support future recommendation system development.

---

## 2. Objective

The objectives of this project are to:

- Clean and prepare the MovieLens dataset for analysis.  
- Engineer meaningful features that provide deeper analytical insights.  
- Explore the dataset to identify trends and relationships between users, movies, and ratings.  
- Demonstrate how engineered features can support building a recommendation system.

---

## 3. Dataset Overview

The dataset used is **MovieLens “ml-latest-small”**, which contains:

- **100,836** ratings  
- **3,683** tag applications  
- **9,742** movies  
- Generated by **610** users between **March 1996 – September 2018**

Each user has rated at least 20 movies.

| File Name   | Description |
|--------------|-------------|
| `ratings.csv` | User ratings (`userId`, `movieId`, `rating`, `timestamp`) |
| `movies.csv`  | Movie titles and genres |
| `tags.csv`    | User-generated descriptive tags |
| `links.csv`   | Links movie IDs to IMDb and TMDb |

---

## 4. Methodology

The analysis followed four main stages:

1. **Data Integration** – Combined `ratings.csv`, `movies.csv`, `tags.csv`, and `links.csv` on `movieId`.  
2. **Data Cleaning** – Removed duplicates, handled missing values, and converted timestamps to readable datetime format.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Created new variables to improve analytical richness.  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** – Applied descriptive statistics and visualizations to identify trends and patterns.

---

## 5. Tools and Libraries Used

All work was carried out in **Google Colab** using **Python**.

| Library | Purpose |
|----------|----------|
| **Pandas** | Data manipulation and cleaning |
| **NumPy** | Numerical operations |
| **Matplotlib** | Data visualization |
| **datetime** | Date-time conversions |
| **re** | Regular expression parsing for text-based features |

---

## 6. Data Preprocessing

### 6.1 Loading and Cleaning
- No duplicate records were found.  
- 13 missing values identified in `tmdbId` were left null.  
- `timestamp` column converted into a readable datetime column (`rating_datetime`) for time-based analysis.

### 6.2 Merging
All four CSV files were merged on `movieId`, resulting in a final cleaned dataset containing **100,836 rows and 9 columns**.

---

## 7. Feature Engineering

Feature engineering was applied to enrich the dataset for deeper analysis and recommendation modeling.

| Feature Name | Description |
|---------------|--------------|
| `release_year` | Extracted from movie title using regex (e.g., *Toy Story (1995)* → 1995) |
| `rating_year` | Extracted from `rating_datetime` |
| `movie_age_at_rating` | `rating_year - release_year` |
| `num_genres` | Number of genres a movie belongs to (split by “\|”) |
| `genre_dummies` | One-hot encoded genres (e.g., Action, Comedy, Drama) |
| `user_mean_rating` | Average rating given by each user |
| `days_since_rating` | Days between rating date and current date |
| `decade` | Derived from release year (e.g., 1995 → 1990s) |
| `tag_count` | Number of tags assigned to each movie |

---

## 8. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA explored **user behavior**, **movie popularity**, and **genre trends** using descriptive statistics and visualizations.

### Key Visualizations and Insights

1. **Distribution of Ratings**  
   - Most ratings fall between **3.0 and 4.5**, indicating generally positive user behavior.

2. **Average Rating by Release Year**  
   - Older movies show slightly lower ratings, while newer ones maintain stable averages.

3. **Top 15 Movies by Rating Count**  
   - Titles such as *Forrest Gump*, *Pulp Fiction*, and *The Shawshank Redemption* dominate user activity.

4. **Rating vs. Movie Age at Rating**  
   - Older films still earn high ratings, suggesting long-term cultural appeal.

5. **Average Rating by Genre**  
   - *Drama*, *War*, and *Animation* receive the highest average ratings.

6. **Movies Released per Year**  
   - A sharp rise in movie releases from the **1990s onward** reflects digital media expansion.

## 9. Key Findings

- Users tend to rate movies positively (**avg. 3.5–4.0**).  
- *Drama* and *War* are the most highly rated genres.  
- Older, classic films maintain relevance across decades.  
- A few highly active users dominate rating activity.  
- Surge in movie production during the 1990s–2000s increased dataset diversity.

These findings highlight viewing trends and inform the design of personalized recommendation systems.

## 10. How the Features Support Recommendation

The engineered features strengthen both **collaborative filtering** and **content-based** models:

| Feature | Recommendation Impact |
|----------|-----------------------|
| `user_mean_rating` | Reduces bias in collaborative models |
| `genre_dummies` | Enables genre-based similarity |
| `days_since_rating` | Supports recency-based personalization |
| `movie_age_at_rating` | Models movie popularity over time |
| `tag_count` | Adds engagement context |
| `release_year / decade` | Supports trend-aware recommendations |

---

## 11. Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrated the **data cleaning**, **feature engineering**, and **exploratory data analysis** processes using the MovieLens dataset.  
Nine new features were created, improving interpretability and model readiness.  
The EDA revealed patterns in user ratings, genre preferences, and popularity trends — forming a strong foundation for future **machine-learning-based recommendation systems**.
